Project Overview:

Participating in the NASA Space App Challenge competition, our project, "Moonquake Simulation 2.0," embarked on the ambitious task of creating a comprehensive lunar seismic simulation from scratch using Unity WebGL. This endeavor not only addressed NASA's challenges but also required us to overcome numerous obstacles while delivering an immersive, scientifically accurate moonquake experience, focusing on site-specific data like moonquake locations, dates, and magnitudes.

Project Goals:

1. Realistic Simulation: Develop an exceptionally realistic moonquake simulation that faithfully represents the moon's surface and provides precise moonquake event information.

2. Visualization: Create an intuitive visual representation of moonquake data to make it accessible and informative for researchers, students, and the general public.

Technical Implementation:

Key technical aspects of our project include:

- Data Collection: We sourced lunar seismic data from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS) to ensure the simulation's foundation is rooted in authenticity.

- Data Processing with ObsPy: Utilized the ObsPy library for rigorous data processing and validation, ensuring the reliability of the seismic data.

How the Project Works:

Our simulation offers users an engaging journey through lunar seismic history. They explore moonquake sites within a 3D lunar model from a space perspective, discovering locations and details of past moonquake events. Interactive highlights provide information about the dates and magnitudes of these events, creating an immersive lunar exploration experience.

Unity 3D Features:

Unity 3D proves to be the ideal platform for this endeavor, offering:

- Performance Optimization: Ensuring smooth user interactions while presenting moonquake data in real-time.

- Lighting and Shading: Enhancing realism with responsive lighting and shading features.

Challenges:

Throughout development, we encountered numerous challenges, including:

- Starting from Scratch: Creating the entire simulation from an empty project in Unity WebGL presented significant challenges, demanding extensive development effort.

- Data Integration: Carefully processing and validating real moonquake data from NASA's PDS, streamlined by the ObsPy library.

- Realism vs. Performance: Balancing realism with real-time performance, considering the demands of resource-intensive simulations.

Our entry, "Moonquake Simulation 2.0," reflects our dedication to the NASA Space App Challenge competition. It offers an immersive, scientifically accurate exploration of lunar seismic activity and stands as a testament to our ability to overcome obstacles while contributing to our understanding of the moon's geology and the broader lunar environment.
